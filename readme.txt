= Beautiful interface =

This was one of our main tasks during the development process, how a user will feel when he/she interfaces with MiwoVideos, front-end and/or back-end. We've made tons of meetings and compared the systems already out, mostly YouTube, Vimeo and Dailymotion. And at the end, we got a modern, beautiful, responsive and powerful video sharing plugin for WordPress.

= Drag & Drop upload =

As the new web technologies tend to move from "cool code" to "cool interface", we implemented an extremely easy to use uploader into MiwoVideos, thought for users and not coders :) All you have to do is to drag and drop the videos, multiple at once. Check out the [details](http://miwisoft.com/wordpress-plugins/miwovideos/drag-drop-upload).

= Channels & Playlists =

Channels are the dynamic version of categories where users can subscribe, like/dislike, attach videos, add thumbnail and banner etc. MiwoVideos puts them a step forward with the Multi-Channel feature which makes them usable as sub-accounts, just like with YouTube. Here you can find more info about [multi-channel](http://miwisoft.com/wordpress-plugins/miwovideos/multi-channel). We've also been inspired by YouTube while implementing the [playlist feature](http://miwisoft.com/wordpress-plugins/miwovideos/playlists), the method to add videos and display them.

= Front-end Management =

[This feature](http://miwisoft.com/wordpress-plugins/miwovideos/front-end-management) offers you to manage the whole plugin as you where in admin panel but from front-end of your site. Of course that every step is controlled by the ACL settings so that only those who have access rights can make any action. Moreover, the whole code is used from the back-end one, not re-written again just for the front-end.

= Migration tools =

You can migrate your data from Wordpress Video Gallery , Cool Video Gallery , WPG Cool Gallery , All Video Gallery and HDW Player plugins within a couple of clicks.

= Modern infrastucture =

MiwoVideos ships with a modern infrastucture with features such as MVC design (no spaghetti code), PHP 5.4, clean URLs with SEF/SEO support, extendible trigger system etc.

= Documentation =

Use the **[miwovideos]** shortcode to display the list of videos.

Further documentation will be maintained on the [Miwisoft.com site](http://miwisoft.com/support).

= Support =

Use the WordPress.org forums for community support. We cannot offer efficient support directly for free.

== Installation ==

= Automatic Installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don't even need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install, log in to your WordPress admin panel, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type "MiwoVideos" and click Search Plugins. Once you've found the plugin you can view details about it such as the the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by clicking "Install Now".

= Manual Installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your site. To do a manual install, log in to your WordPress admin panel, navigate to the Plugins menu, click Add New, click Upload (top links) and finally select the downloaded file.

We do not collect information about you or your server.
